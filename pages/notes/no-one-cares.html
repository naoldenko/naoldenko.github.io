		<q style="font-size: 18px;">We all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own</q><p style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 0px;">- Marcus
			Aurelius
</p>
		<p>Have you ever felt like no one listens to you?
			You continuously try to garner attention from others that you forget the most straightforward philosophy in
			our
			existence: no one cares.</p>

		<p>That’s a harsh generalization, but people are selfish in their own self-interested ways. They care much more
			about themselves, but when inflicted by those surrounding them it causes the affected to introspect.</p>

		<p>Why do we introspect?</p>

		<p>It’s a natural human process. When people say negative remarks toward others it causes the individual to
			think
			more about themselves. Their ego is inflicted leading to mental disarray. The more people get affected by
			such
			individuals, it leads to develop a better idea of who they should surround themselves with.</p>

		<p>For me, for example, I’ve noticed that trying to irritate others to listen to me is utterly tiring. Yet, I
			start
			ruminating thinking about every aspect of the process of trying to gain the opposition’s interest. You could
			say
			my intentions are selfish as well. However, the infliction the opposing party invokes brings forth
			difficulties
			for me. This leads to the introspection that stirs up in our minds when we’re attacked, making us feel weak
			but
			instead strengthening us.</p>

		<p>The more you think that no one listens to you, but criticizes you, shouldn’t lead simply to introspection,
			but
			rather an epiphany of acknowledging that there are potential gains provided later in the future.</p>

		<p>Therefore, who cares that no one cares.</p>

		<p><b>Just live.</b></p>
