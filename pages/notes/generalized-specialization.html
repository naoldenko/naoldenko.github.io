		<p><b>Generalized Specialization </b><i>(Noun)</i></p>
		<p><i>A generalist who specializes in given strengths/interests</i></p>

		<p>Not sure if someone coined this term, but I had this thought a couple of weeks ago.
		</p>

		<p>Several people say “Oh, it is much better to specialize for X, Y, and Z” while others say it’s better to
			generalize.</p>

		<p>I saw a post on Quora, that resonated with me.</p>

		<p>Life will forever be a balancing act figuring out what works and what doesn’t. Yet, generalized
			specialization
			in my opinion allows you to know more about everything but be more focused.</p>

		<p>For example, as for me, I classify myself as a builder, writer, and musician. I like to build startups, write
			stories/poems, and make music. There are a lot of things that go under those umbrellas.</p>

		<p>Building startups requires know-how’s on coding, design, sales, marketing, etc.</p>

		<p>Writing stories/poems requires knowing the structure, literary devices, etc.</p>

		<p>Making music requires knowing how to produce, mix, master, songwriting, etc.</p>

		<p>There are many facets underneath each one, but you’re generally generalizing specialization. Generalizing by
			doing various interests while specializing in a select few interests and focusing on gaining depth within
			them.</p>

		<p>I believe there are plenty of people who are doing this today and many refer it to as “wearing many hats,”
			but I
			feel that this concept of generalized specialization is a crucial way to enjoy a varied lifestyle and be
			able to
			live every single day fresh.</p>
