	<h1>Tomorrow Is Never Promised...</h1>
	<h3>April 2023</h3>
	<div id="text">
		<p>Tomorrow is a day we have no control over; where the mind of an individual lingers on the hope of success in
			the
			new day. As hopeful as we can be, these “tomorrows” are not promised. Life does not care about the plans we
			make. Everyone is on their own, and to live another day is a huge feat.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I wonder, “Why do we keep planning ahead,” we become so in love with devising our future a decade
			from
			now, that we forget to realize that tomorrow is not inevitable, but uncertain. There’s nothing wrong with
			short-term planning; like what to do today for example, or maybe a week, but still, there’s a continual
			dilemma
			of not knowing the unknowns of the time ahead.</p>

		<p>Living life may be better planned than living spontaneously, however, that may vary for different
			individuals.
			Spontaneity is simply living in the moment, and not thinking about the future. Businesses would not be able
			to
			succeed this way; that is why the business plans they have created are written to “predict” the company's
			future; yet they’re highly speculative and provide some semblance of direction.</p>

		<p>However, if it were about humans living a life of spontaneity, it is rather interesting. You never have to be
			anxious about what will happen next; you will just go with the flow. The consequences as to why this will
			eventually become detrimental are that you will be putting yourself in situations that you never expected to
			be
			in.</p>

		<p>There are downfalls in both ideas, but finding harmony between the two spectrums allows a lively experience.
		</p>

		<p>We already know the idea of how balance is a must in life, but implementing this lifestyle of balance is
			vital.
			Being spontaneous while simultaneously being prudent will make life more varied and fresh.</p>

		<p>So, yes, tomorrow is not promised, but, we shall enjoy today for now and not frivolously spend our finite
			seconds being anxious about tomorrow.</p>
