	<h1>The Societal Norm</h1>
	<h3>August 2024</h3>
	<div id="text">
		<p>There is only so much we can do.</p>

		<p>We all own the same 24 hours, divided to our own liking. Expending time doing what we love is glorious, yet
			sometimes infeasible. </p>

		<p>Thus, we are confined by <b>the societal norm</b>.</p>

		<p>The societal norm is what lures us in. A sense of comfort we conform into. Taking risks is intolerable
		for the average individual, even so if the risk is taken they are highly unlikely to succeed. However, this is
		what motivates them to prevail and prove the opposers wrong that gives them a smidge of being successful.</p>

		<p>This norm we are confined into takes us from enjoying the facets of existence, let alone our pastimes. We are
		continuously fighting the norm in our daily lives, by doing what we are doing repeatedly without further
		understanding the digestion of its purpose.</p>

		<p>The norm is what keeps us “safe” or “lukewarm” from the recurring societal division. A haven for the lack of
		opinions, the norm is what others succumb into for a sense of relief from the chaos.</p>

		<p>Although, this brings into question, why the division or opinions?</p>

		<p>On a planet where the primary species were born to reason, it is indefinite, not limited, of the ability of
		those to have a thought on pressing issues concerning society.</p>

		<p>However, is it good to be opinionated?</p>

		<p>To unearth this question, you must define “opinionated.” Opinionated in what? Does the context matter of what is
		being opinionated on? Or should we conform to the societal norm and prevent ourselves from immersing ourselves
		in the very things we despise or appreciate to take a stand on, to ensure we leave the peripheral of the eyes of
		discrimination.</p>

		<p>The societal norm is an issue we will continue to face in our daily lives, from the youngest of ages to the
		oldest. It starts and never ends, as it will forever be a continual dilemma, but through a truce to
		understanding the nuances of living, it will be a journey of constant hope and relearning.</p>
