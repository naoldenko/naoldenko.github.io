	<h1>Why Mental Health Matters</h1>

	<p>Why does mental health matter? For many like myself, it's to remain sane. When I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder, I felt lost, confused, and was drowned with many unwanted feelings. It took me a while to realize that many people suffered from a mental illness, and some never get treated. Now I tell myself I'm "one of the lucky ones" because I decided to get treated. Sometimes I wonder if I didn't get treated, would I be alive today? I'm fortunate to have a group of family and friends that cared about me and brought willing support during difficult times. I wouldn't be here writing this today without them.</p>
	<p>So does mental health matter? Yes, it does! Your mental health is one of the most important parts of being a functioning human being. Ignore the stigma, and take care of yourself. The most important person in life is yourself, and if you can't take care of yourself, you won't be able to help others. I strongly stand by this! After several talks with family, friends, psychiatrists, and social workers, I've developed a mindset to keep my mental health first. Whenever I'm in a stressful place, I simply question myself, evaluate the situation, and take immediate action. Never think you're weak or you'll let yourself lose. You're stronger than you think!</p>
	<p>Life is unpredictable, you'll never know when things will go up or down, but if you take care of yourself, the repercussions will be less. Always live a balanced life; do well at your job, find time to do hobbies, spend time with family and friends, and simply enjoy your life. I believe that mental health is integral for people; it shouldn't be stigmatized, many suffer severely and fear to get help because of it. As we continue to live our lives, I believe that one day we will finally destigmatize mental health and people will be able to gain access for help.</p>
