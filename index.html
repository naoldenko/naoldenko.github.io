	<div id="bio">
		<p>Hello. As always, welcome. So, who am I? I am simply a male that identifies as a Black individual, who currently resides in the Northern Hemisphere on Planet Earth. What are my interests? I enjoy music, sports, and anything that appeals to me. Why am I writing this? Felt like it'd be cool to have a site. Where am I right now? In my kitchen, coding on my laptop. When did I do this? Sometime late January 2022. How? Used my typical IDE; Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <p>So, the real me. Born in South Africa to my Ethiopian parents. Came to Canada in 2002. Lived in Malton for a bit and relocated to Brampton. Went through school, played sports, blah, blah. Eventually went to university to play football, went through some stuff, came back home, attended college; played a lot of basketball, like a lot; founded a couple startups, didn't succeed, but learned invaluable skills; eventually transferred to university with some of my college credits to study economics and psychology... So, yeah. My life in a nutshell. Anyway, I aspire to do work in different fields, but consulting speaks to me, as I love the problem-solving aspect of it. I'm continually developing my skills through various involvements, but I look forward to amusing people, while solving problems. Anyhow, if you ever want to chat, connect with me on LinkedIn or shoot me an email (ndenko@uoguelph.ca).</p>
