	<div id="bio">
		<p>Hello. As always, welcome. So, who am I? I am simply a Black individual that identifies as a male, who
			currently resides in the Northern Hemisphere on Planet Earth. What are my interests? I enjoy music, sports,
			creative writing  and anything that appeals to me. Why am I writing this? Felt like it'd be cool to have a site. Where am I
			right now? In my kitchen, coding on my laptop. When did I do this? Sometime late December 2022. How? Used my
			typical IDE; Visual Studio Code.</p>
		<p>So, the real me. Born in Durban, South Africa to Ethiopian parents. Came to Canada in 2002. Lived in Malton for a
			bit and relocated to Brampton. Went through school, played sports, blah, blah, blah. Eventually went to university
			to play football, went through some stuff, came back home, attended college; played a lot of basketball...
			like a lot; founded a couple startups, didn't succeed, but learned invaluable skills; eventually transferred
			to university with some of my college credits... So, yeah. My life in a
			nutshell. Anyway, I aspire to do work in the football recruiting realm, as I love working with athletes and
			helping them succeed. I'm continually developing my skills through various involvements, but I look
			forward to having fun with people. Anyhow, if you ever want to chat, shoot me an email: <a href="mailto: naoldenko@outlook.com">naoldenko@outlook.com</a></p>
